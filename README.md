# In-Her-Shoes-Simulation
A repository for the In Her Shoes virtual reality simulation project.

The goal of this project was to develop a virtual reality version of the card-based domestic violence simulation. The Washington State Coalition against domestic violence currently produces a card simulation where students move from card to card learning about real-life domestic violence situations and appropriate ways to respond and get help. Members of the project team worked closely with Dr. Kristie Chandler in Samford University's Human Development and Family Science Department to better understand and approach this task.

The resulting program runs on an Oculus VR system and simulates several rooms in a domestic setting. Without having any triggering or disturbing imagery, the program uses very similar cards as the physical simulation. The user can select different decisions to make based on the scenario presented.
